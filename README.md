### Step 0 (Optional)
Setup a working c++ environment, including:
- A compiler (e.g. g++)
- Standard libraries.

On Windows, one recommendation is [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org). Follow their HOWTO, or look up one of numerous youtube videos available.
When compiling, be sure to enable **c++11** as well as **optimizations**. (For g++, enabling c++11 is achieved with the **--std=c++11** or **--std=c++0x** flag; and optimizations is achieved with the **-O2** or **-O3** flag).
